# Causal-Discovery-Flow-Cytometry-Data
In this project, various methods for causal inference were applied on a dataset from the paper Causal Protein-Signaling Networks Derived from Multiparameter Single-Cell Data, where they were able to almost reconstruct a known causal signaling pathway using Bayesian networks. The following algorithms were used:

* PC-algorithm
* Tabu search with modified BDe score (bnlearn)
* Greedy interventional equivalence search (GIES) algorithm
* Backshift algorithm

Additionaly, the methods were tested on a simulated dataset, with a similar causal structure as the Sachs data.
